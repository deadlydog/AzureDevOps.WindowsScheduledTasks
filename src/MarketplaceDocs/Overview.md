# Windows Scheduled Tasks

This extension provides build/release tasks that can be used to install and uninstall Windows Scheduled Tasks.


## Requirements

This extension requires the computer that the Scheduled Task will be installed/uninstalled on to be Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 or greater, as that's the first version of Windows that introduced the [ScheduledTasks PowerShell cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/scheduledtasks/?view=win10-ps) that this extension uses.
