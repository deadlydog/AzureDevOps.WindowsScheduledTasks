# Windows Scheduled Tasks VSTS Extension

This is an VSTS extension that allows Windows Scheduled Tasks to easily be installed and uninstalled.

## Additional ideas to implement

* Allow XML file to be used to specify Scheduled Task parameters (allow for different credentials to run the task as).
* Allow jitter to be added to scheduled start time.
